Slick2D and project-local Maven repositories
--------------------------------------------
repo contains a project-local maven repository for handling 3rd party jars
that aren't included in a proper maven repository. I can't take credit for
this brililant idea, so the URL where I found it is here:

Although LWJGL is included in a proper maven repository, the Slick2D library
is not. So, I downloaded the Slick2D library from here:

    http://slick.cokeandcode.com/downloads/slick.zip

Then I added lib/slick.jar to the project-local repository with the following
command:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=slick.jar -DgroupId=com.cokeandcode -DartifactId=slick -Dversion=274 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=/path/to/xcom/repo

Note that everything in the command above is arbitrary. I've tried to follow
the pattern of other artifacts in other repositories. The version (274) comes
from Slick2D itself. Upon starting up, it outputs the following message:

    INFO:Slick Build #274

Small Font and Spacing
--------------------------------------------
X-COM has two fonts, large and small. The large glyphs tend to take up their
entire width and are drawn next to each other with no pixels in-between. The
small fonts tend to get drawn directly upon the last column of pixels from
the previous glyph; the next letter is drawn on top of the shadow of the
previous letter.

So far I've seen two exceptions:

1. There is no glyph for the "space" character, although the game does use
   consistent spacing (large 10px, small 5px) where a "space" would be. In
   my code, I have defined a "space" glyph into existence; a wholly transparent
   mask defined to be N pixels wide. So far, this works well.

2. In the small font, there is an uppercase 'L' character. In screen captures
   from the actual game, it looks like the letters following the 'L' are not
   only drawn on the shadow of L, but yet one further pixel to the left; they
   are actually drawn upon the bottom line of the L itself.

   Thus far, I haven't done anything about it. This makes it slightly
   inconsistent from X-COM. I have been weighing the desire to stay faithful to
   the way X-COM draws everything and the desire to keep the code clean/simple.
   I've already defined a width for ' ' (the space character), so doing it for
   the uppercase 'L' in the small font isn't *that* big a step, but then again
   the spacing for it does not really bother me enough to change it right now.
