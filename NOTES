Slick2D and project-local Maven repositories
--------------------------------------------
repo contains a project-local maven repository for handling 3rd party jars
that aren't included in a proper maven repository. I can't take credit for
this brililant idea, so the URL where I found it is here:

Although LWJGL is included in a proper maven repository, the Slick2D library
is not. So, I downloaded the Slick2D library from here:

    http://slick.cokeandcode.com/downloads/slick.zip

Then I added lib/slick.jar to the project-local repository with the following
command:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=slick.jar -DgroupId=com.cokeandcode -DartifactId=slick -Dversion=274 -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=/path/to/xcom/repo

Note that everything in the command above is arbitrary. I've tried to follow
the pattern of other artifacts in other repositories. The version (274) comes
from Slick2D itself. Upon starting up, it outputs the following message:

    INFO:Slick Build #274
