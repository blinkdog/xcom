TO DO
-----
- Add a mouse input listener to language selection state
- Add option to allow buttons and text to be rendered with inverse colors
  (useful when 'clicking' a button)
- Add a sound sample decoder
- Add capability to play decoded sound samples (SoundRenderer?)
- Modify Label to allow centering based on label text width
-- Main menu does not look right with German version of "Enemy Unknown"
- Add a mouse input handler to the game loading state
- Add a mouse input handler to quit the editor
- Implement the game load state; display the buttons, game comments, game time
- Create a geoscape state
- Add a mouse input handler for all the geoscape buttons
- Create a polygon globe
- ...

IDEAS
-----
- When removing an alien from alien containment, play the reload weapon sound,
  followed by the rifle shot sound, followed by the appropriate death scream
  for the race of the alien.

LOW PRIORITY TASKS
------------------
- Refactor all of the PimpMyXcom static method nonsense (the stuff that
  handles the application properties) into a nice set of configuration
  classes; an entity, a DAO, a service, etc. in com.rpgsheet.xcom.config
