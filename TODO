IDEAS
-----
- When removing an alien from alien containment, play the reload weapon sound,
  followed by the rifle shot sound, followed by the appropriate death scream
  for the race of the alien.

LOW PRIORITY TASKS
------------------
- Refactor all of the PimpMyXcom static method nonsense (the stuff that
  handles the application properties) into a nice set of configuration
  classes; an entity, a DAO, a service, etc. in com.rpgsheet.xcom.config

- Handle the spacing of the uppercase 'L' in the small font so that it better
  matches real screen captures from X-COM.

- Convert Button to use the "SINGLE_LINE_CENTER" LabelStyle when creating
  its internal Label object?
